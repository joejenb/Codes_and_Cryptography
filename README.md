## Overview
Project can be split into two parts: Compression and Cryptography. For both of which a short report was written.

## Compression
Given a tex file, must perform lossless compression on an unknown corpus of text. Marks were awarded for resulting file size and originality of ideas used. For details please see gltc66_compression.pdf.

## Cryptography 
Given an 16bit string encrypted with ECB, known to give a specific location, must decrypt string and obtain location. For details of how this was achieved, please refer to gltc66_cryptography.pdf.
